Built from the ground up with attention to detail throughout, this truck delivers both visual impact and serious performance.
 At the heart of the build is a fully built GM crate motor, complemented by shorty headers and a meticulously detailed engine bay. The setup is clean, aggressive, and purpose-driven  offering strong power delivery while maintaining reliability. The engine bay presentation reflects the level of craftsmanship that went into the entire build.
 The suspension has been upgraded with a new 4-link setup, dramatically improving stance and drivability while giving the truck a planted, performance-oriented feel. New brakes and a new fuel tank ensure that the mechanical foundation matches the fresh performance components.
 Finished in brand-new paint and complemented by a completely redone interior, this GMC feels as fresh as it looks. The stance is unmistakable, sitting on massive 24x14 rear wheels and 22x8.5 fronts, wrapped in 405 tires all around  giving it an aggressive, wide footprint that commands attention from every angle.
 This is not a refreshed truck  its a fully reimagined OBS build executed with modern components and show-ready detail.
