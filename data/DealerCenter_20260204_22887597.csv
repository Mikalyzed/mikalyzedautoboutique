 This  1992 Nissan President  is a mostly original example, with only minor touch-up paint, preserving its classic elegance.

 Power comes from a  5.0L V8 engine , mated to an automatic transmission, providing effortless performance and a whisper-quiet ride. These sedans were equipped with  luxury features ahead of their time , including a  rear entertainment TV system, full leather interior, wood-trimmed cabin, power seats, automatic climate control, and premium sound system . The suspension and chassis were tuned for ultimate comfort, making this car feel more like a  private chauffeur-driven sedan  than a typical driver�s car.
 Well-maintained and  mostly original , this President offers a rare opportunity to own a  classic Japanese luxury sedan  that blends performance, comfort, and exclusivity.

 This  1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe  is one of the cleanest surviving examples of its kind � a true collector-grade car with just  1,140 original miles . Found preserved in a  climate-controlled garage in South Miami , this SS has been meticulously cared for its entire life. The previous owner purchased it at only 699 miles and sparingly drove it around his neighborhood solely to keep the mechanical components in proper working condition. The car presents exactly as you�d expect from such a well-preserved example �  immaculate throughout , with even the  original tires free of flat spots or dry rot .
 Under the hood lies Chevrolet�s  5.0L High Output (305 CID) V8 engine , rated at  180 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque , paired with a  4-speed automatic transmission  and  3.73 limited-slip rear differential . The Aerocoupe was designed with NASCAR homologation in mind, featuring a distinctive  aerodynamic sloped rear window and extended deck lid  that set it apart from the standard Monte Carlo SS. Only  6,052 Aerocoupes were produced in 1987 , making this model both rare and highly sought after among collectors.
 Everything functions as it should, and the car drives just as new � smooth, tight, and true to its heritage. The paint, interior, and trim all show beautifully, retaining that unmistakable 1980s GM charm.
 A true  time capsule , this Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe represents the final chapter of GM�s rear-wheel-drive NASCAR homologation era � a rare opportunity to own a near-new example of an American performance icon.

 This 1983 Porsche 911 SC Cabriolet is a rare and highly distinctive example, featuring a professionally executed slant nose conversion crafted entirely in aluminum. Unlike the fiberglass kits commonly seen, this conversion was performed by one of the few select West Coast shops of the era, where skilled metalworkers painstakingly shaped and fitted aluminum bodywork by hand. These limited-production conversions are now regarded as functional art pieces, embodying the craftsmanship and vision of 1980s automotive culture. Power comes from the factory 3.0L air-cooled flat-six, producing 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission and rear-wheel drive. Known for their durability and engaging performance, the SC drivetrain remains a benchmark for classic Porsche reliability and driving enjoyment. The interior continues the period-correct aesthetic with sport seats featuring checkered pattern inserts, matching door panels, off-white dials, and a Momo steering wheel. Together, these details capture the unmistakable 1980s Porsche character while complementing the car�s bespoke exterior.

 This 2020 Ferrari 488 Pista is an exceptional example of Ferrari�s most celebrated modern track-focused Berlinetta. The Pista represents the peak of Ferrari�s twin-turbo V8 development, powered by a  3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8  producing  710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque , paired with a lightning-fast  7-speed F1 dual-clutch transmission . With its extensive use of carbon fiber, advanced aerodynamics, and reduced weight, the Pista delivers breathtaking performance with a 0�60 time of around  2.7 seconds  and razor-sharp handling engineered directly from Ferrari�s GT championship programs.
 One of the rarest and most desirable features of this particular Pista is its  factory radio delete . Ordered without an infotainment system, this option strips unnecessary weight and distractions, emphasizing purity, lightweight performance, and a true racing pedigree. Radio delete cars are  exceedingly rare  and sought after by collectors, reflecting a focus on driving experience over amenities�much like Ferrari�s most historic competition builds.
 The 488 Pista�s design incorporates  S-duct front aerodynamics, larger front intakes, carbon-fiber components throughout, and titanium exhaust , all contributing to increased downforce and reduced overall mass. Every angle of the car is engineered for performance, from the sculpted side channels to the aggressive rear diffuser.
 Inside, the cabin features a minimalist, motorsport-inspired environment with  Alcantara, carbon fiber, and exposed finishes , further enhancing the race-bred nature of this specification.
 This Pista stands as an extraordinary example� rare, highly focused, and built for pure driving emotion . With its radio delete configuration and performance pedigree, it represents the true essence of what the Pista was designed to be: a raw, lightweight, and uncompromised Ferrari meant for enthusiasts and collectors who appreciate the pinnacle of modern Ferrari engineering.

 This 2017 Jeep Wrangler has been comprehensively built into a serious, turn-key off-road machine, combining rugged capability with bold visual presence. Power comes from the proven  3.6L V6 , delivering reliable performance whether cruising on the street or tackling demanding terrain.
 The exterior has been fully upgraded with  custom metal fenders ,  VPR 4x4 metal front and rear bumpers , and  VPR 4x4 metal inner fenders , giving the Jeep a tough, purpose-built stance. A  Superwinch winch  is mounted up front for recovery, while the rear bumper features  integrated LED lighting  for added visibility.  Aftermarket side steps  improve access and everyday usability, and a  King soft top  keeps things versatile for open-air driving.
 Suspension and steering have been properly addressed with  Fox springs and shocks all around , paired with an  Apex steering column and Fox steering stabilizer , resulting in confident handling and control even with its aggressive setup. The Wrangler sits on  4Play 22-inch wheels  wrapped in massive  38x15.5x22 Mickey Thompson Baja Boss tires , giving it an unmistakable presence and serious off-road capability.
 Inside, a  DS18 speaker system  delivers upgraded sound quality to match the Jeep�s bold personality. This is not a lightly modified Wrangler � it�s a thoughtfully built example designed to stand out visually while remaining fully functional and trail-ready.

 This 1972 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 is a rare and highly original barn find, remarkably preserved in nearly untouched condition. Discovered in a closed garage on jack stands with a license plate last registered in 1988, this Z28 has had minimal handling since its storage and presents almost exactly as it was found�an authentic time capsule from the early 1970s. Powering this classic is the legendary 350ci (5.7L) small-block V8, producing 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed manual transmission and rear-wheel drive. The drivetrain remains fully functional, and the engine has received only basic maintenance, allowing enthusiasts to experience it as it was originally intended. This Z28 was found with protective measures still in place, including tape on the exhaust, an empty fuel tank, and waxed chrome to prevent pitting over decades. Interiors were lightly vacuumed to preserve original materials, highlighting the care taken by its previous owner. As one of the few completely original Z28s from the early �70s still in existence, this Camaro represents a rare opportunity for collectors seeking a genuine, untouched example. Offered as-is, it is a once-in-a-lifetime find that embodies the authenticity and heritage of Chevrolet�s iconic pony car.

 This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro is a no-compromise full restomod, combining timeless first-generation Camaro styling with modern performance and show-quality execution. Built on a Heidts full aftermarket chassis, it delivers dramatically improved handling, ride quality, and overall driving dynamics.
 
 Power comes from a beautifully dressed GM LS3 6.2L V8, an all-aluminum engine known for its reliability and performance, producing approximately 430+ horsepower in factory form. Featuring sequential fuel injection, coil-near-plug ignition, and modern engine management, the LS3 offers smooth power delivery, strong mid-range torque, and excellent street manners while maintaining a clean, professional engine bay presentation.
 
 The rear has been extensively reworked with a mini-tub setup, 4-link suspension, 12-bolt rear end, Panhard bar, and rear sway bar, paired with a full coil-over suspension for confident, planted handling. A molded rear end further cleans up the exterior and reinforces the high-end finish throughout.
 
 Finished in brand-new Kameleon Manik Orange, the paint shifts beautifully in the light and highlights the Camaro�s aggressive stance and iconic body lines. The combination of modern LS power, advanced chassis engineering, and bold color makes this Camaro equally at home at shows or on the road.
 
 A thoughtfully executed restomod that blends classic muscle car presence with modern drivability, this 1969 Camaro stands out as a well-built, turn-key example.

Exterior paint is mostly original and shows light wear consistent with age, while the 15-inch �snowflake� style wheels complete the classic Jaguar look. This example includes its books and documentation, underscoring its well-kept history. A gentleman�s convertible through and through, this XJ-S is a refined British classic that offers a true grand touring experience.
